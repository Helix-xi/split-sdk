## Introduction

StellarSplit SDK is a TypeScript-first library that provides:

- **Invoice management** — create, fund, track, and settle payment invoices on Stellar
- **Multi-wallet support** — connect MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, Freighter, and more
- **Batch operations** — group payments and Soroban contract calls for efficiency
- **SEP integrations** — SEP-31 cross-border payments, SEP-10 auth, and more
- **Telemetry and observability** — hooks for error monitoring, performance tracking

We welcome contributions of all sizes — from typo fixes in docs to large new features. Every issue in our tracker is a candidate for community contribution. Please read this guide in full before opening a pull request.

> **Important:** Do not begin coding until a maintainer has assigned you to an issue. Comment on the issue first and wait for assignment.

## Branch Naming Conventions

Create a feature branch from `main`. Use the following prefixes to indicate the type of change:

| Prefix    | Purpose                                      | Example |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|---------|
| `feat/`   | New feature or capability                    | `feat/issue-1130-freighter-adapter` |
| `fix/`    | Bug fix                                      | `fix/issue-42-null-address-crash` |
| `docs/`   | Documentation changes only                  | `docs/issue-1081-contribution-guide` |
| `chore/`  | Tooling, build, CI, dependencies             | `chore/upgrade-vitest-2.0` |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring with no behavior change  | `refactor/split-calculator-cleanup` |
| `test/`   | Adding or improving tests only               | `test/invoice-state-machine-coverage` |
| `perf/`   | Performance improvements                     | `perf/batch-payment-optimization` |

### Branch naming format

```
<prefix>/issue-<NUMBER>-short-description
```

```bash
# Examples
git checkout -b feat/issue-1130-freighter-adapter
git checkout -b fix/issue-42-null-address-crash
git checkout -b docs/issue-1081-contribution-guide
```

Keep descriptions short (3–5 words), lowercase, hyphenated. **Never commit directly to `main`.**

---

## Commit Message Format

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. All commit messages must follow this format:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit types

| Type       | When to use |
|------------|-------------|
| `feat`     | A new feature |
| `fix`      | A bug fix |
| `docs`     | Documentation only changes |
| `style`    | Code formatting, missing semicolons (no logic changes) |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without feature/bug change |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore`    | Build process, tooling, dependency updates |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements |
| `ci`       | CI/CD configuration changes |
| `revert`   | Reverting a previous commit |

### Examples

```
feat(wallet): add FreighterAdapter for Stellar browser extension (#1130)

fix(invoice): handle undefined return from freighter signTransaction (#42)

docs(contributing): add Conventional Commits guidance (#1081)

test(batch): add coverage for 101-operation rejection case

chore: upgrade vitest to 2.0.0
```

### Rules

- Subject line: **≤ 72 characters**, **imperative mood** ("add feature", not "added feature")
- Reference the issue in the footer or subject: `(#42)` or `Closes #42`
- Use the body to explain **why**, not just **what**
- Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit

### Setting up commit linting locally (optional)

```bash
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
# Add to package.json: "commitlint": { "extends": ["@commitlint/config-conventional"] }
```

---

## Development Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

> If you encounter peer dependency conflicts, use:
> ```bash
> npm install --legacy-peer-deps
> ```

### 2. Build the project

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles TypeScript to the `dist/` directory using the project's `tsconfig.json`.

### 3. Run in watch mode (optional)

```bash
npm run build -- --watch
```

### 4. Type-check without emitting

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### 5. Lint your code

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Environment variables

The SDK does not require environment variables for development. If you are running integration tests against a real Stellar testnet, you may optionally set:

```bash
STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
```

---

## Code Style

StellarSplit SDK enforces **TypeScript strict mode** across the entire codebase. The following rules are non-negotiable:

### TypeScript strict configuration

The `tsconfig.json` enables:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "strictFunctionTypes": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true
  }
}
```

### Code style rules

1. **No `any` types.** Use `unknown` and narrow with type guards instead. If `any` is truly unavoidable, add a comment explaining why.
2. **Explicit return types** on all exported functions and class methods.
3. **JSDoc comments** on all exported functions, classes, and interfaces.
4. **Prefer `const`** over `let`. Avoid `var`.
5. **No unused imports** — remove them before committing.
6. **Use `.js` extensions** in all import paths (required for ESM compatibility):
   ```typescript
   import { StellarSplitError } from './errors.js';  // ✅
   import { StellarSplitError } from './errors';      // ❌
   ```
7. **Error handling** — always extend `StellarSplitError` for SDK errors, never throw raw strings.
8. **Async/await** preferred over `.then()` chains.
9. **Keep functions small** — aim for ≤ 40 lines per function. Extract helpers.
10. **Immutable data** — prefer `readonly` modifiers on interface properties.

### Example of correct style

```typescript
/**
 * Fetches the current balance for a Stellar account.
 * @param accountId - The Stellar public key to query.
 * @param asset - The asset to look up, defaults to XLM.
 * @returns The balance as a string with 7 decimal places.
 * @throws {@link StellarSplitError} when the account does not exist.
 */
export async function getAccountBalance(
  accountId: string,
  asset: Asset = Asset.native()
): Promise<string> {
  // ...
}
```

---

## Testing

### Test runner

The project uses **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)** as the test runner. Tests are located in the `test/` directory.

### Running all tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Running a specific test file

```bash
npm test -- freighterAdapter
npm test -- batchOperations.test.ts
```

### Running with verbose output

```bash
npm test -- --reporter=verbose
```

### Watching tests during development

```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

### Writing new tests

All new functionality **must** include tests. Test files should:

- Live in `test/` and follow the pattern `<FeatureName>.test.ts`
- Use `describe` blocks to group related cases
- Use `it` for individual test cases (descriptive names)
- Use `vi.fn()` and `vi.mock()` for mocking dependencies

Example test structure:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, vi, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import { MyFeature } from '../src/myFeature.js';

describe('MyFeature', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.clearAllMocks();
  });

  it('returns the correct result for valid input', () => {
    const result = MyFeature.compute('valid-input');
    expect(result).toBe('expected-output');
  });

  it('throws MyError when input is invalid', () => {
    expect(() => MyFeature.compute('')).toThrow(MyError);
  });
});
```

### Test coverage expectations

- New features: **aim for ≥ 90% coverage** on the new code
- Bug fixes: add a test that **reproduces the bug** before the fix
- Run coverage report: `npm test -- --coverage`

2. **Read the full issue description** including any linked discussions.
3. Comment: *"I'd like to work on this."*
4. **Wait for a maintainer to assign you.** Do not fork and start coding before assignment.
5. Only one contributor per issue at a time — respect active assignments.

### How to report bugs

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/Stellar-split/split-sdk/issues) to check if the bug is already reported.
2. If not found, open a new issue using the **Bug Report** template.
3. Include:
   - SDK version (`npm list split-sdk`)
   - Node.js version
   - Minimal reproduction code snippet
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Stack trace if applicable

### How to request a feature

1. Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/Stellar-split/split-sdk/discussions) first to gauge interest.
2. If the maintainers support it, they will open a tracked issue.
3. Feature requests become issues only when they are scoped and actionable.

### Asking questions

- Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Stellar-split/split-sdk/discussions) — not issues — for questions.
- For quick questions, comment on the relevant issue thread.

### Key design patterns

- **Adapter pattern** — all wallet integrations implement the `WalletAdapter` interface from `types.ts`
- **Error hierarchy** — all SDK errors extend `StellarSplitError` with a `code` string for programmatic handling
- **Event emitters** — typed event emitters (`TypedEventEmitter`) for observable state changes
- **Pure functions** — utility modules (e.g., `diff.ts`, `paymentSplitCalculator.ts`) are side-effect-free

---

## Security Guidelines

Security vulnerabilities must **not** be reported in public GitHub issues. Follow these guidelines:

### Reporting a vulnerability

1. Email the maintainers privately at the address listed in `SECURITY.md`.
2. Provide: description, steps to reproduce, affected versions, and potential impact.
3. Allow **14 days** for an initial response before public disclosure.
4. We aim to release a fix within **90 days** of confirmed reports.

### Security best practices for contributors

- **Never commit private keys, secrets, or API tokens** — not even testnet keys.
- Use `.env` for local secrets and ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`.
- Validate all external input — treat Horizon API responses as untrusted.
- Use `StellarSplitError` subclasses — never leak internal stack traces to end users.
- When implementing cryptographic operations, use established libraries (e.g., `@stellar/stellar-sdk`) — do not roll your own.
- Avoid `eval()`, `Function()`, or dynamic `import()` with user-controlled strings.
- Dependencies: check `npm audit` before adding new packages.

```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```
