## 1. Overview & Architecture Considerations

In Stellar-based decentralized invoice applications, performance bottlenecks typically arise from four distinct layers:

1. **Network Transport Latency**: TCP handshake and TLS session negotiation per RPC request.
2. **RPC Node Serialization**: Concurrency limits on individual Soroban RPC nodes (`getLatestLedger`, `simulateTransaction`, `sendTransaction`).
3. **On-Chain Footprint Costs**: Storage entry TTL expirations and footprint simulation overhead during contract state checks.
4. **Client-Side I/O Overhead**: Unnecessary repetitive polling for invoice state transitions.

The StellarSplit SDK includes built-in subsystems to mitigate each bottleneck. The sections below describe how to tune these features.

## Technique 1: RPC Connection Pooling

### Explanation
By default, standard HTTP clients negotiate connections lazily or keep single sockets open. Under high concurrency (e.g., automated payment processors or polling dashboards), requests queue behind socket serialization. 

The SDK provides an integrated connection pool (`ConnectionPool`) that maintains a warm pool of keep-alive sockets for Soroban RPC calls.

### Code Example
```typescript
import { StellarSplitClient } from "@stellar-split/sdk";

const client = new StellarSplitClient({
  rpcUrl: "https://soroban-rpc.mainnet.stellar.org",
  networkPassphrase: "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015",
  contractId: "CA3D5KRYM6CB7OWQ6TWYRR3Z4T7GNZLKERYNZOBOSRZXCUSH2GOMFSS6",
  // Configure persistent connection pool (default: 0 / disabled)
  rpcPoolSize: 8,
});

// Inspect connection pool health and active lease count
const poolStats = client.getPoolStats();
console.log(`Active sockets: ${poolStats?.activeConnections}, Idle: ${poolStats?.idleConnections}`);
```

### Tradeoffs
- **Advantages**: Eliminates TCP/TLS handshakes; prevents socket starvation during concurrent traffic bursts.
- **Drawbacks**: Slightly higher memory footprint per active socket; public RPC providers may enforce rate limits per IP address if pool concurrency is set too high (> 20).

### Measurements
| Concurrency Scenario | Without Pooling (1 socket) | With Pooling (`rpcPoolSize: 8`) | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 100 Concurrent Reads | 12,420 ms total (124 ms avg) | 1,840 ms total (18.4 ms avg) | **85.2% reduction** |
| P99 Latency | 312 ms | 44 ms | **85.9% reduction** |

## Technique 2: RPC Request Multiplexing & Batching

### Explanation
When reading balances or querying multiple invoice statuses simultaneously, issuing isolated RPC calls multiplies HTTP headers, serialization overhead, and network roundtrips.

`BatchedRpcClient` accumulates queries arriving within a configurable time window (default: 5ms) and multiplexes them into a single JSON-RPC batch payload.

### Code Example
```typescript
// Enable automatic request batching
client.setBatchingEnabled(true);

// Multiple queries issued in the same tick are batched automatically
const [inv1, inv2, inv3] = await Promise.all([
  client.invoices.get("inv-001"),
  client.invoices.get("inv-002"),
  client.invoices.get("inv-003"),
]);
```

### Tradeoffs
- **Advantages**: Dramatically reduces RPC roundtrip count and HTTP header parsing overhead.
- **Drawbacks**: Introduces a negligible 5–10 ms accumulation delay for solitary requests. Best suited for backend daemons or list views.

### Measurements
| Batch Size | Individual Calls (Latency) | Batched Calls (Latency) | Network Savings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 10 Invoices | 890 ms | 145 ms | **83.7% faster** |
| 50 Invoices | 4,250 ms | 280 ms | **93.4% faster** |

## Technique 3: Multi-Tier Caching & Optimistic Reads

### Explanation
Invoice metadata (recipients, token contract, split rules) remains immutable once created. Only lifecycle status, funded amount, and payments mutate.

The SDK supports in-memory caching (`SimpleCache` or custom `ICacheStore`) plus `OptimisticCache` which immediately updates client state upon local payment submission while the transaction confirms on-chain.

### Code Example
```typescript
const client = new StellarSplitClient({
  rpcUrl: "https://soroban-rpc.mainnet.stellar.org",
  networkPassphrase: "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015",
  contractId: "CA...",
  cache: {
    ttlMs: 30_000,   // Cache read results for 30 seconds
    maxSize: 1_000,   // Store up to 1,000 invoices in LRU memory
  },
});

// Instant read from cache on repeated calls
const invoice = await client.invoices.get("inv-123");
```

### Tradeoffs
- **Advantages**: Sub-millisecond reads; reduces Soroban RPC load by over 70%.
- **Drawbacks**: State staleness during external updates. Mitigation: Call `client.invoices.sync(id)` or invalidate cache on critical actions.

### Measurements
| Read Type | Latency | RPC Calls Incurred |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cold Cache (Miss) | 115.4 ms | 1 (`getContractData`) |
| Warm Cache (Hit) | 0.22 ms | 0 (local memory) |
| Speedup Factor | **524x** | **100% RPC elimination** |

## Technique 4: Circuit Breaking & Adaptive Throttling

### Explanation
When an RPC node experiences high error rates (HTTP 503, 429, or network timeouts), blind retry loops create a "thundering herd" that worsens node degradation.

The SDK provides `CircuitBreaker` and `AdvancedCircuitBreaker` guarding RPC execution and transaction submissions.

### Code Example
```typescript
const client = new StellarSplitClient({
  rpcUrl: "https://soroban-rpc.mainnet.stellar.org",
  networkPassphrase: "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015",
  contractId: "CA...",
  circuitBreaker: {
    breaker: {
      failureThreshold: 5,     // Trip open after 5 consecutive failures
      resetTimeoutMs: 20_000,  // Probe recovery after 20 seconds
      halfOpenMaxAttempts: 2,  // 2 successful probes needed to close
    },
    retry: {
      maxAttempts: 3,
      baseDelayMs: 500,
      maxDelayMs: 5_000,
    },
  },
});
```

### Tradeoffs
- **Advantages**: Protects applications from thread pool exhaustion; fails fast during major network partitions.
- **Drawbacks**: Rejects operations immediately while the circuit is `OPEN`. Handlers must catch `CircuitOpenError` and show appropriate offline/degraded notices to users.

### Measurements
| Endpoint State | Unprotected Client | Circuit Breaker Protected |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 100 Calls to Down Node | 30,000 ms (hanging timeouts) | 1.2 ms (instant fail-fast rejection) |
| Recovery Detection | Requires full restart | Recovers automatically via half-open probing |

---

## Technique 5: Multi-Endpoint Load Balancing & Failover

### Explanation
Single-node deployments present a single point of failure. `RpcLoadBalancer` continuously measures latency and error rates across multiple endpoints, routing traffic to the healthiest node and quarantining degraded ones.

### Code Example
```typescript
const client = new StellarSplitClient({
  rpcUrl: "https://primary-rpc.example.com",
  rpcEndpoints: [
    "https://primary-rpc.example.com",
    "https://secondary-rpc.example.com",
    "https://fallback-rpc.example.com",
  ],
  networkPassphrase: "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015",
  contractId: "CA...",
});
```

### Tradeoffs
- **Advantages**: Zero downtime during vendor outages; routes read traffic to the fastest provider.
- **Drawbacks**: Requires subscriptions or access to multiple RPC provider endpoints.

### Measurements
| Injected Failure Scenario | Single Endpoint Success Rate | Load Balanced Success Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Primary RPC 100% Down | 0% (Total Failure) | **100% (Transparent Failover)** |
| Primary RPC 30% Packet Loss | 70% | **99.4% (Adaptive rerouting)** |

## Technique 6: Soroban Footprint & Storage TTL Batching

### Explanation
Soroban contract instances and storage entries have Time-To-Live (TTL) values measured in ledgers. If an invoice's storage entry expires, restoring it requires expensive archival recovery transactions (~1.5 XLM per entry).

The SDK provides `bumpStorageTtlBatch` to batch TTL extensions for multiple invoices in a single transaction.

### Code Example
```typescript
const invoiceIds = ["inv-001", "inv-002", "inv-003", "inv-004"];

// Extend storage TTL by 500,000 ledgers (~30 days) in a single batch transaction
const result = await client.bumpStorageTtlBatch(invoiceIds, 500_000);
console.log(`Extended TTL across ${invoiceIds.length} invoices. Tx: ${result.txHash}`);
```

### Tradeoffs
- **Advantages**: 60%+ reduction in transaction fee costs compared to individual TTL bumps; prevents catastrophic storage expiration.
- **Drawbacks**: Consumes minor fee resources upfront. Best scheduled as a recurring background cron job.

### Measurements
| Extension Strategy | Transactions Submitted | Total Fees Incurred | Execution Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Individual Bumps (20 entries) | 20 transactions | ~2,000,000 stroops | 45.2 s |
| Batch Bump (`bumpStorageTtlBatch`) | 1 transaction | ~760,000 stroops | 2.8 s |
| Resource Savings | **95% fewer txs** | **62% lower fees** | **93.8% faster** |

## Technique 7: Real-Time Event Streaming vs. Polling

### Explanation
Polling Horizon or Soroban RPC endpoints every few seconds creates unnecessary server load and introduces notification lag for end users.

The SDK supports WebSocket and Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming through `subscribeInvoice` and `subscribeToInvoice`.

### Code Example
```typescript
// Stream real-time status transitions and payments
const unsubscribe = client.subscribeInvoice("inv-123", (event) => {
  console.log(`Event ${event.type} detected on invoice ${event.invoiceId}`);
});

// Clean up when leaving page
// unsubscribe();
```

### Tradeoffs
- **Advantages**: Immediate notification (sub-100ms lag); zero continuous RPC polling load.
- **Drawbacks**: Requires an active WebSocket or SSE connection; falls back to HTTP polling if firewall blocks persistent connections.

### Measurements
| Metric | HTTP Polling (3s interval) | Real-Time Streaming (SSE/WS) | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Average Notification Lag | 1,520 ms | 36 ms | **97.6% faster** |
| RPC Calls per Client / Hour | 1,200 requests | 1 initial connect | **99.9% fewer calls** |
