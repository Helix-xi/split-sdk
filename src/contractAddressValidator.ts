/**
 * Soroban contract address validation for StellarSplit (issue #1065).
 *
 * Validates contract identifiers (`C...` addresses) against the Stellar
 * StrKey standard before they are used to build or submit transactions, so
 * mistyped or corrupt contract IDs fail fast locally instead of producing
 * on-chain failures.
 *
 * ## Validation rules
 *
 * A valid Soroban contract address must satisfy all of the following:
 *
 * 1. **Type** — a non-empty string (`typeof address === "string"`).
 * 2. **Length** — exactly 56 characters.
 * 3. **Prefix** — starts with `C` (the contract StrKey version byte).
 * 4. **Alphabet** — every character is in the RFC 4648 base32 alphabet
 *    (`A`–`Z`, `2`–`7`); base32 is case-sensitive, so lowercase is rejected.
 * 5. **Checksum** — the trailing two characters encode a CRC16-XModem
 *    checksum over the version byte plus the 32-byte payload, as defined by
 *    the StrKey specification (CAP-0005 / SEP-0023).
 *
 * Rules 2–4 are reported as the `format` check; rule 5 is reported as the
 * `checksum` check. Both must pass for the address to be valid.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { validateContractAddress, isValidContractAddress } from "@stellar-split/sdk";
 *
 * isValidContractAddress("CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABSC4"); // true
 *
 * const result = validateContractAddress("CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABSC5");
 * result.format;    // true  — well-formed, only the checksum is broken
 * result.checksum;  // false
 * result.errors;    // ["Contract address failed CRC16 checksum validation"]
 * ```
 */
