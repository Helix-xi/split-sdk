/**
 * Error recovery strategies for StellarSplit SDK (issue #1068).
 *
 * Maps every {@link SdkErrorCode} (issue #1067) to a concrete recovery
 * strategy describing what a caller should do when that failure occurs:
 * retry as-is, retry with backoff, refresh state and rebuild, correct the
 * input, switch to a fallback endpoint, wait for external state to change,
 * or abort.
 *
 * The mapping is exhaustive by construction — adding a new error code without
 * declaring its recovery strategy is a compile error.
 *
 * @example Inspect the strategy for an error
 * ```ts
 * import { getRecoveryPlan } from "@stellar-split/sdk";
 *
 * try {
 *   await client.pay(invoiceId, amount);
 * } catch (err) {
 *   const plan = getRecoveryPlan(err);
 *   console.log(plan.strategy.action);  // e.g. "retry_with_backoff"
 *   console.log(plan.suggestion);       // human-readable remediation
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example Automatic recovery
 * ```ts
 * import { executeWithRecovery } from "@stellar-split/sdk";
 *
 * const result = await executeWithRecovery(() => client.getInvoice(invoiceId), {
 *   onRetry: (attempt, strategy) => console.warn(`Retry ${attempt}: ${strategy.description}`),
 * });
 * ```
